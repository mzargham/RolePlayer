#RolePlayer

## Description
This repository contains an innovative storytelling system designed to interact with GPT-4, an advanced language model by OpenAI. It facilitates dynamic story creation, character development, and scene setting, offering a unique platform for creative writing, role-playing scenarios, and AI-driven narrative experimentation.

## Key Features
- Dynamic Story Creation: Automatically generates storylines, scenes, and dialogues.
- Character Management: Handles character creation, including their backstories, and tracks their progress throughout the story.
- Scene Development: Facilitates the setting and progression of scenes, driven by AI.
- Interactive Dialogue: Engages in dynamic dialogue between characters, driven by prompts and AI responses.
- Verbose Mode for Storytelling: Offers a verbose mode to provide detailed insights into the story progression, scene creation, and dialogue exchanges.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to sketch out "dynamic game" for interactive storytelling. All roleplayers are text-based input-output agents who maintain knowledge of their experiences within game. In the feature we want to use this to mix human and non-human players and to use war games to evaluate LLM agents.
